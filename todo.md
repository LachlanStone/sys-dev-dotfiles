# Version 2
- I want to impliment the ability to create my own .file for folder structure like stowrc
- Redo the code to detect all the folders, then go in
    - if .file exist uses its config
    - if .file does not exist used .config and move folder

# TODO
- VIM in General
    - Confirm how to open the VIM Command line window
- Setup a NeoVIM Directory INIT Script
    - Have this script linked to this repo as looking to setup neovim now as linking doing the editing within vim as this is quite quick
- Setup TMUX
    - Force the numbers to fix so that this does not happen
